Initiated in 1998 by a £7M Wellcome Trust Cardiovascular Research Initiative Award and consolidated by over £20M in serial BHF strategic awards, the groups constituting the CVS came together on the Little France campus in 2005 to form a \"Centre for Cardiovascular Risk & Resolution\" in the Queen's Medical Research Institute (QMRI). Today CVS has core facilities and training programs across three buildings at Little France - the QMRI, the Chancellor's Building, and the Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine.",
