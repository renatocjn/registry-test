For GC-MS profiling analyses, polar metabolite extracts are chemically converted, i.e. derivatised into less polar and volatile compounds, so called analytes.  This collection references analytes.",

The founding director was Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. Lothar Willmitzer, who is the director of one of the three departments which have been established since then. From originally only 16 employees the institute grew into a large institute, which now employs about 360 people from all over the world, who put their combined efforts into elucidating the secrets of plants.",
